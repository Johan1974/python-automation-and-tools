# Band Name Generator

A lightweight Python application that generates creative band names based on user input.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an **interactive console-based application** that takes user input and generates a meaningful output.  
Although simple, it showcases clean code, string handling, and user interaction logic — skills applicable in larger Python automation and utility projects.

## Features

- Interactive console input for personalized output
- Combines multiple user inputs to generate a creative result
- Easy-to-read, maintainable Python code structure

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd band-name-generator
```

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python3 band_name_generator.py
```

Follow the prompts to generate your unique band name.

### Example

```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Utrecht
What's your pet's name? Tony
Your band name could be: Utrecht Tony
```

## Technical Highlights

- Handling user input with `input()`
- Dynamic string formatting with f-strings
- Console output for interactive applications
- Structured, commented Python code

## Potential Extensions

- Add a random word generator for more creative band names
- Save generated names to a file
- Build a GUI version for web or desktop
